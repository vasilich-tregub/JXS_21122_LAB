This folder contains Python scripts of ISO-21122-Part4-ed3 updated for use with Python3. 

LICENSE: This is a derived work. All rights for the original Python scripts reside with Thomas Richter <thomas.richter@iis.fraunhofer.de>.
See README-Original.

The script jxscodestream.py outputs the parsed content to stdout; you can redirect the output to a file:

>>> py jxscodestream.py 200.jxs > 200.txt

(200.jxs is an examplary jpeg xs file from ISO-21122-Part4-ed3 you can fing in this folder)

Scripts for JPEG flavours other than JPEG XS are converted but not tested.

The conversion for Python2 to Python3 for these scripts mostly consists in replacing the Python2 print statement (print args) 
with the Python3 print method (print(args)) and modifying exception catch. Also, redundand ord's were removed.
