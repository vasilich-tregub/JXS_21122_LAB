# JXS_21122_LAB

The code samples in subfolders can be used to understand the working of the JPEG XS 
reference codec. Some use the static library build with the reference codec software, 
JPEG 21122, part 5, ed3, published by ISO. These are best used as extras with 
the reference software package. The other ones are independent pieces of code 
that attempt to implement JPEG XS algorithms and functions recovered in the course 
of back engineering the reference software.
